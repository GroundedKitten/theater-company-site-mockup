This file gives credit to sources and tools that I consulted and used in my extensive work on this project. 

CSS
  - I can explain all of my markup. I added some comments, trying to find a balance between what might be useful and what might not be needed.
  - I realize some of the css is quite advanced. I went down some learning/exploratory rabbit holes (e.g., the custom classes/vars as I thought this was a cool way to simplify my responsive queries. By creating my root font size and hero width, I was able to use a percentage of that for my content width and simply change that in the media queries. The custom classes for the font-icon colors and hover colors might seem a bit much, but I was happy I did that when I started playing/changing those colors as it facilitated that process. I imagine this also makes the css easier to follow, not only for devs but perhaps even for client admins at some point).
  - I consulted a couple of Udemy courses to create the animations. I tinkered quite a bit with the settings and timing to get the vintage flickering effect for the marquee sign. I consulted the moz developer tutorials quite a bit in this part of the work. 

FONTS
  - All fonts that were not free I purchased from CreativeFabrica and own full commercial  licenses for. 
  - Roboto font and variants are from Google Fonts and used under their standard license. 
  - I converted most fonts, which came as .tff and/or .otf files, with several online tools, such as Convertio, AnyConvert, and similar. I explored creating my own .bat file but discarded that to refocus on the crux of the project. I did get some practice with some cmd tasks such as robocopy and learning some basic switches during this process (e.g., robocopy C:\source-dir C:\destination-dir /move /e with the first switch being responsible for deleting the source files after they are moved and the /e to include empty subdirs...I believe /s would ignore the empty subdirs in robocopy executions).

IMAGES
  - All Font Awesome icons are part of the FA 6 free library and used under their standard open license.
  - Any other icons were either purchased or freely downloaded from CreativeFabrica. 
  - The three fictious flyer tiles I created with Bing Image Creator and give full credit to. 
  - I used various compression tools although predominantly TinyPNG and ShortPixel, which gave comparable results, perhaps with a slight edge to ShortPixel, at least on filesize. I learned how to use Krita and explored creating custom scripts but discarded this as I was able to achieve a good amount with the built-in save options for .jpeg and .png files. I recall that flattening the image was helpful and there were some other little techniques to reduce file sizes. I learned a bit about .svg files although did not get into .svg paths as they hurt my brain when I looked at them. 
  - I used some images for inspo when creating my marquee and now-showing sings, mostly through Google/Bing image searches, but I did not copy any of those.
  - I used a few tools on PineTools when I was dealing with images earlier in my work, but I don't believe any of those made it to the final mockup.
  - I used the image resizer in PowerToys and Canva to resize some images and then optimized them with the tools mentioned above

COLORS
  - I learned a great deal about color in this assignment, such as hex, rgb, rgba, including alpha transparency. I learned less about the other formats but see that transparency is built into one of those. I used screen colorpickers from PowerToys, ShareX, and Krita to identify colors from the mockup images, then explored their hex values on ArtyClick's Color Name Finder and their Dictionary, then played with settings, explored colors and palettes, and attempted to create a palette that reflected the spirit of an iconic local theater site. I got the sense that Griot was a fictious name for Chicago Theater, so I learned a bit about the history to guide me in creating my own fictious content for the mockup. I did that because I imagine that, when submitting a mockup to a client, demonstrating that the devs understand the history, culture, and mission of their work/services/products will build rapport and confidence in that relationship. That in turn might open space for productive dialogue and perhaps more creative space, which is a part of the process I am quite enjoying so far.
  - Any color names lingering within the css comments are from ArtyClick
