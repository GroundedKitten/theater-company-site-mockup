I have worked extensively on this project and have done the work myself, consulting resources such as stackoverflow, asking questions with chat (but always playing with the markup and understanding what I'm doing, breaking things and fixing them as Kevin mentioned in the intro videos). I had a lot of fun making the marquee sign. I also consulted some lessons in some Udemy courses I have to be able to do that. The only work I did not do is the js file to create the scannable option on the QR-reader (just a fun add-on). I will add that acknowledgment in a comment to the js file as well.
